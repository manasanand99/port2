## Projects
### CHATBOT OPEN AI
#### AWS Lambda, OpenAI, FastAPI, Python, Jinja2
[Github](https://github.com/manasanand99/Football_Data_Analytics)

The **Chatbot OpenAI Project** is deployment of an advanced chatbot system. The project employs OpenAI to generate human-like responses to text input, ensuring a natural and dynamic conversational experience. **AWS Lambda** serves as the deployment platform, offering scalability and efficiency. **FastAPI**, a modern web framework for Python, facilitates the development of a robust backend, while **Jinja2** is employed for crafting an interactive and responsive front-end template. This integration of AI-driven responses, serverless deployment, and user-friendly web interfaces positions the project at the forefront of conversational AI, offering a seamless and engaging interaction for users.

### IMAGE TO PROMPTS: Computer Vision using Python
#### TensorFlow, Python, Matplotlib, NLTK, Sklearn, Jupyter, Inception V3, Pytorch
Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects **computer vision** and **natural language processing**. In this report, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. We used a pretrained model and applied it to the dataset. Experiments on several datasets show how the accuracy of the model is changing. Also, by changing the number of epochs we observed change in BLEU score. For instance, we have achieved BLEU-1 score of 0.32 for 5 epochs whereas obtained BLEU-1 score of 0.43 for 30 epochs.

### ESTIMATING TRAFFIC THROUGH SATELLITE IMAGE
#### Detectron2, torch, pyyaml, pandas, QGIS, google collab, Deep Learning
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16BlptDYoOFvC0RROaHPiIaVD_rcyCZ3W)

High-resolution satellite imagery has lately become available to the general public, and it can be used to locate vehicles. The vehicle information contained in the image can be used to estimate traffic and the aim of this project is to develop a model to estimate traffic on road by analyzing the satellite images. Also, to utilize the existing VMT (Vehicle Miles Travelled) data for a region and correlate it with the results of satellite image. We have collected VMT summary statistics data from local government agencies Department of Transportation and high-resolution satellite images from Hurricane Harvey Imagery website. We have used a Detectron 2 and faster R-CNN model to count the number of cars in a satellite image. We have used this model to detect the count of vehicles specific to zip code.

### Prediction of Bubble Point Pressure and Oil Formation Volume Factor Using Machine Learning Techniques
[Github](https://github.com/manasanand99/bpp_and_oil)
In reservoir management, comprehending reservoir fluid properties and phase behaviors is vital. Traditional laboratory PVT tests for this can be costly and time-intensive. When direct data is lacking, predicting Bubble Point Pressure (BPP) and Oil Formation Volume Factor (OFVF) using field-measurable variables through machine learning is advantageous. This study assessed 567 filtered crude oil fluid samples worldwide, employing diverse machine learning algorithms. Models, including Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine, were explored, with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models demonstrating superior accuracy (R2=0.98 and 0.92 for BPP and OFVF). These ANN models outperformed empirical correlations, and a novel multilinear regression equation achieved high predictive accuracy (R2=0.92) for Bubble Point Pressure.

### Football Data Analytics: From Wikipedia Through Azure and Apache Airflow to Tableau
#### Apache Airflow + Postgres, Docker, Azure Data Lake, Azure DataFactory, Azure Synapse, Tableau
[Github](https://github.com/manasanand99/Football_Data_Analytics)
The Football Data Analytics project is a comprehensive endeavor involving the extraction, processing, and analysis of football-related data. Utilizing Wikipedia as a prime data source, the project employs Azure for efficient data storage and processing, establishing a robust foundation. Task scheduling and workflow automation are streamlined through Apache Airflow, ensuring a seamless and orchestrated data flow. The ultimate goal is to derive valuable insights from football data, facilitating strategic decision-making. The project culminates in the visualization of these insights using Tableau, providing a user-friendly interface for enthusiasts and analysts to explore and understand various dimensions of the game.

### Sentiment Analysis in the Era of Large Language Models
####  Large Language Model, Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RZye2ILbGf_qJSCvUKZgTmPeEPDw6Sd_)

Code-switching, the amalgamation of multiple languages within a sentence or conversation, is increasingly prevalent. However, limited code-mixed data poses challenges for effective pre-training of large language models, especially in low-resource languages like Marathi. This project addresses sentiment analysis in code-mixed data, a multi-class classification task predicting sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). Utilizing word-level language classifiers to detect language, we tested various models on new datasets. Evaluating on downstream NLP tasks, our architecture incorporates diverse BERT model variations trained on unsupervised learning tasks. Focusing on Hindi-English and Marathi-English mixed data, the project compares mahaNLP and l3cube-pune/Marathi-sentiment-md models for efficiency across diverse datasets, offering a comprehensive analysis.

### COVID-19 Statistics Across States
#### Tableau, Tableau Prep Builder, Microsoft Excel

Conducted comprehensive data cleaning tasks encompassing removal of duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and scrutinizing for errors and outliers. Validated data against reliable sources and meticulously documented the entire cleaning process within Tableau. Developed calculated fields for advanced data analysis, including metrics like average age of civilian casualties and percentage change in case intensity over time. Constructed an interactive dashboard in Tableau to analyze and visualize the impacts of covid on populations, featuring multiple visualizations. Explored a spectrum of chart types, from bar charts to scatter plots, effectively leveraging visualization techniques for diverse operational scenarios. Additionally, crafted custom charts like Lollipop, Waterfall, Funnel, and Butterfly Charts using Tableau.
